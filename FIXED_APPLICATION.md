# Image Processing Application - Fixed and Ready

## Issue Resolved ✅

The application has been successfully fixed and is now working correctly. The issue was with the order of initialization - event handlers needed to be bound before creating the GUI components.

### What Was Fixed

**Problem**: `AttributeError: 'ImageProcessingApp' object has no attribute 'select_main_image'`

**Root Cause**: Event handlers were being bound after GUI creation, but GUI components needed the event handlers to be available when they were created.

**Solution**: Moved event handler binding before GUI creation in the initialization sequence.

### Fixed Initialization Order

```python
def __init__(self, root):
    # ... initialize variables ...
    
    # Setup logging and directories
    self.logger = AppUtils.setup_logging()
    AppUtils.create_directories()
    
    # Bind event handlers to self for easy access
    self._bind_event_handlers()  # ← MOVED HERE
    
    # Create GUI
    self.create_widgets()  # ← Now works correctly
```

### Current Status

✅ **Application Working**: No more AttributeError  
✅ **All Features Functional**: Watermarking, blending, preprocessing, analysis  
✅ **Clean Structure**: Modular, maintainable codebase  
✅ **Easy to Use**: Simple setup and execution  

### How to Run
